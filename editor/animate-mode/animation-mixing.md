# Animation Mixing

Rive allows you to mix animations from the same artboard at runtime, creating more interesting ways for you to add interactivity to your apps and games.

In this example, four different animation states are being mixed together to produce this pull to refresh animation. Read more on how to do this on the [Runtime](../../runtimes/play-animation/mixing-animations.md) page. 

Currently, Rive doesn't allow you to preview the animations mixing within the editor, but in the future, we will add ways to do this.
