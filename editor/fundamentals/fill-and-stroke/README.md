## **Fill**

The Fill section of the Inspector allows you to add and modify the fill properties of the currently selected object. You can create as many fills as you like.

### **Fill type**

You can apply different fill types to shapes. These include:

* Solid
* Linear gradient
* Radial gradient

### **Fill rule**

The Fill Rule determines how overlapping paths in a shape will be filled:

* **Non-Zero** fills the entire shape, including any overlapping paths.
* **Even-Odd** does not fill the holes in overlapping paths.

## **Stroke**

You can apply different stroke types to shapes. These include:

* Solid
* Linear gradient
* Radial gradient

### **Cap**

The Cap option determines how the endpoints of strokes with open paths should be rendered.

* **Butt** The end of the stroke is a straight line and does not extend beyond the end vertices. On a zero-length path, the stroke will not be rendered at all.
* **Round** The ends of a stroke are rounded. On a zero-length path, the stroke is a full circle.
* **Square** The ends of a stroke are squared off and extend beyond the end vertices. On a zero-length path, the stroke is a square.

### **Join**

The Join option determines how the corners of paths should be rendered.

* **Round** creates a rounded corner.
* **Bevel** creates a beveled corner.
* **Miter** creates a mitered corner.
