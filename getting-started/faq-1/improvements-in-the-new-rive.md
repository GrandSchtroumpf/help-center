# Improvements in the new Rive

Looking at upgrading from the [old Rive](https://flare.rive.app) \(formerly Flare\) to the [new Rive](https://rive.app)? Here's a list of some of the new features! 

* The new editor is collaborative. You can work with your team on the same files, in real time, from any location.
* The new editor has a ton of new features \(like snapping, better [selection tools,](../../editor/fundamentals/groups/selecting-and-navigating-groups.md) improved [grouping](../../editor/fundamentals/groups/), improved [draw order](../../editor/animate-mode/animating-draw-order.md)\) and behaves more like common screen design tools, so most designers will feel at home.
* There are new runtimes that are lighter weight and more efficient, particularly the native [iOS](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android) ones.
* The web runtime is a massive improvement with a much smaller file size and two options: a powerful low-level [wasm runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm) and a [simpler version](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm/tree/master/js) that is easy for anyone to use.
* The new Rive will continue to receive new features, like our upcoming [cloud renderer](https://feedback.rive.app/55) and [visual state machine](https://feedback.rive.app/322), as well as new game engine runtimes.
