# Requirements and troubleshooting

## What are the system requirements for Rive?

Currently, you can access the Rive editor via your web browser of voice, or our native macOS app. All modern browsers are supported, although we recommend you use a computer with a dedicated graphics card for optimal performance.

Take advantage of our native macOS app for increased performance. You'll need macOS Catalina or above.

Windows and Linux versions of Rive will be coming in the future.

## Can I use Rive on multiple computers?

Yes, you can use Rive on as many computers as you like. Simply log in to your account via the browser or the macOS app to access all your personal and team files.

Whilst you can use Rive on multiple computers personally, you'll need individual accounts for multiple users across computers.

## How many people can use my account?

Accounts are intended for individual use. If you want to work with a team, each team member should have their own account. Per our [Terms of Service](https://www.2dimensions.com/terms), and for your security, your account may be locked if we notice that multiple people are using it.

## What happens if my internet connection goes down?

Your files are always saved in the local storage of your browser. Even if your connection goes down, you can continue working on your file. As soon as your connection is back, Rive syncs with our online revision manager. Just make sure you find a connection before opening the file on another computer, otherwise you will not see the latest revision of that file.
